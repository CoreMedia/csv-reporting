In the Library, a new toolbar option has been added: “CSV”. 

### Browse Mode
In Browse mode, clicking the CSV button will initiate an export of all content in the currently selected folder, including content in subfolders.

When the button is pressed, a pop-up dialog indicates the selected folder, which contains the content to export. A different template may be selected for the report by using the dropdown list. The export button is disabled if there are no templates available. Pressing the “Export” button will initiate the generation of a new CSV file, which is automatically downloaded by the browser.

Pressing the “Export” button will initiate the generation of a new CSV file, which is automatically downloaded by the browser.
